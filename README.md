# RankedBW Bot (Archived Source)
All information contained within this repository is 1:1 to the Ranked Bedwars server as of extremely recent.
This repository contains an archived version ( +- 2 Weeks ) of the RankedBW (Ranked Bedwars) bot, including historical source code, assets, and configuration files. At the time of archival, certain vulnerabilities or implementation details existed which, if publicly disclosed earlier, could have resulted in severe disruption or termination of the server. These issues have since been patched and no longer pose a risk.
While those specific issues are no longer applicable, the repository still contains a substantial amount of functional logic, structure, and design material. With modification, this codebase can be repurposed or expanded into another RBW-style system. The repository also serves as a reference for individuals interested in understanding how the RankedBW bot was structured and operated. There may also be more information that poses a risk to the server that I have not yet spotted.
The project includes a large number of original RankedBW assets, such as logos, branding materials, and concept designs, as well as legacy configuration files used during development and operation. All are in the highest quality possible.

Notable locations within the repository include the following paths:

- `rankedbw-tickets-old-main/assets/images`  
  Contains photos, logos, and concept designs related to Ranked Bedwars.

- `rankedbw-tickets-old-main/assets/photoshop`  
  Contains original Photoshop files, including logo source files.

- `rankedbw-worker-main/src/settings.ts`  
  Contains historical Discord bot tokens and configuration data. These tokens are no longer valid and are included strictly for archival and educational reference.


EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE:
Due to GitHub file size limitations, all assets have been removed from the main repository. Asset files are provided separately and attached alongside this repository under clearly labeled directories, such as `Asset_Photos` and `Asset_Photoshop`.
If these assets are used, they must be placed into their corresponding directories and renamed to match the original structure by removing the `Asset_` prefix from the folder name. Once renamed and placed correctly, the repository layout will match its original state.
This repository is provided as-is for educational, archival, and experimental purposes only. No guarantees are made regarding functionality, security, or suitability for production use. The authors assume no responsibility for misuse, redistribution, or modification of the contents of this repository.
