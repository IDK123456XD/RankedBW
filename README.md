This is the RankedBW bot, all information accurate to the server as of 01/02/2026 (or there abouts).
While certain information that, if released 2 weeks ago, could of resulted in the end of the server (or atleast it nuked), sadly they have been patched.
There is, however, lots of mess around with and this can easily be turned into another RBW.

This also has lots of assets used in RBW, such as the logos, and for those genuinally interested in how their bot works this is it!


Cool Locations:
 - rankedbw-tickets-old-main.zip\rankedbw-tickets-old-main\assets\images ( Photos, Including Logos and Concept Designs [RANKED BEDWARS BATTLEGROUNDS] )
 - rankedbw-tickets-old-main.zip\rankedbw-tickets-old-main\assets\photoshop ( Photoshop Photos, Including Logo )
 - rankedbw-worker-main.zip\rankedbw-worker-main\src\settings.ts ( Old Discord Bot Tokens )


EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE
rankedbw-tickets-old-main.zip\rankedbw-tickets-old-main\assets
    Due to file size being too large for github, all assets have been removed. Attached to this github will be Asset_Photos / Asset_Photoshop seperately.
If this is used, it will be named specifically so you can put it into the right location and remove the "Asset_" part to make it how it should be.
Thank you.
